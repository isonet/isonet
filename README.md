# Hey there, I'm Paul 👋

I'm a **Principal Software Engineer** at [idealo](https://github.com/idealo), where I specialize in building and scaling backend systems. My primary tech stack includes **Java w/ Spring** ☕ for development, **AWS** ☁️ for cloud infrastructure, and **Terraform** 🛠️ for automating infrastructure through **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. I’m passionate about building systems that are both reliable and scalable, and I love solving complex technical problems.

## What I Do:
- 🌐 **Backend Engineering**: I design and implement high-performance backend systems and APIs, focusing on making them scalable and easy to maintain.
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure**: I leverage **AWS** to build cloud-native applications, ensuring that everything is highly available, cost-effective, and optimized for performance.
- ⚙️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: I use **Terraform** to manage infrastructure, ensuring that everything is reproducible, versioned, and automated.
- 🔍 **System Optimization**: I work on improving the scalability and performance of existing systems, using a combination of monitoring tools, code optimizations, and infrastructure changes.
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: I’m a strong advocate of agile methodologies, working closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that products meet business and technical requirements.

## When I'm Off the Clock:
- 🧪 **Homelab Enthusiast**: I enjoy tinkering with my **homelab**, where I experiment with new technologies, deploy personal projects, and learn new skills.
- 🏠🤖 **Home Automation**: I’m a big fan of automating my home with **Home Assistant**, making everything from lighting to security smarter and more efficient.
- 💡 **DIY IoT Projects**: I'm passionate about building **DIY IoT** devices using **Esphome** and **ESP32** microcontrollers. It’s a great way to dive deep into electronics and software simultaneously.
- 💻 **Side Projects**: I always have a side project or two on the go. Whether it’s exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, or building something for fun, I’m always looking for ways to learn and create.
- 🛠️ **Tech Enthusiast**: Whether it’s cloud computing, automation, or hardware hacking, I’m always excited to explore new tech and figure out how I can use it to solve real-world problems.
