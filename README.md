# Hey there, I'm Paul 👋

I'm an **Engineering Manager** at [STACKIT](https://github.com/stackitcloud), where I am helping to build and scale a European hyperscaler. I lead the team responsible for the **cloud pricing engine**, ensuring that complex usage data is rated and calculated into costs with absolute precision. We utilize **Go** to engineer the distributed systems that drive the financial logic of the platform.

## What I Do:
* 💰 **Cloud Pricing & Rating**: I oversee the design and lifecycle of the pricing services, transforming usage data into accurate financial records.
* 🚀 **High-Performance Go**: My team uses **Go** to build efficient, scalable microservices capable of handling complex pricing rules and high-volume data streams.
* 👥 **Engineering Leadership**: I mentor and empower my team, ensuring technical excellence while navigating the intersection of billing logic and distributed system architecture.
* ⚙️ **Financial Accuracy**: I focus on building systems where correctness is non-negotiable, ensuring zero-error tolerance in cost calculation and rating.
* 🤝 **Strategic Collaboration**: I work closely with product and finance stakeholders to implement flexible pricing models that meet business requirements without sacrificing system performance.

## When I'm Off the Clock:
* 🧪 **Homelab Enthusiast**: I enjoy tinkering with my **homelab**, where I experiment with new technologies, deploy personal projects, and learn new skills.
* 🏠🤖 **Home Automation**: I’m a big fan of automating my home with **Home Assistant**, making everything from lighting to security smarter and more efficient.
* 💡 **DIY IoT Projects**: I'm passionate about building **DIY IoT** devices using **Esphome** and **ESP32** microcontrollers. It’s a great way to dive deep into electronics and software simultaneously.
* 💻 **Side Projects**: I always have a side project or two on the go. Whether it’s exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, or building something for fun, I’m always looking for ways to learn and create.
* 🛠️ **Tech Enthusiast**: Whether it’s cloud computing, automation, or hardware hacking, I’m always excited to explore new tech and figure out how I can use it to solve real-world problems.
